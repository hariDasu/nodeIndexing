##nodeCrawlin

The output of the crawler can be found at http://crawler.srihari.guru/output.html

The source code is available to download at https://github.com/hariDasu/nodeCrawlin

The final working files are crawlManagur.js and crawlWorkur.js

I have added the logic to extract the top level pages to an output folder, and they are named as pagei.html, where i changes sequentially.
